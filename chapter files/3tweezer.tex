The tool used in this work to achieve single-atom control is optical tweezers: by focusing a laser beam to a small enough spot it has been shown that under the right conditions, this trap can house at most one atom (\cref{sec:LoadingAtoms}).
Subsequently, \cref{sec:DiffractionLimit} introduces the fundamental limit on the tweezer geometry. 
In \cref{sec:TweezersPractice} practical constraints of the specific setup used are introduced, after which \cref{sec:MeasuringTweezer} introduces the optical setup used to measure the optical dipole presented in \cref{sec:TweezerRadial,sec:Tweezer3D}.

\section{Loading Single Atoms}\label{sec:LoadingAtoms}

Single atom loading was first demonstrated by \cite{Schlosser2001}.
In \cite{Schlosser2002} it is described by an elegant model taking into account one-body as well as two-body loss terms. 
Denoting the average number of atoms in the dipole trap by $N$, we can write for the time evolution of $N$ \cite{Schlosser2002} 

\begin{equation}\label{LoadingTweezer}
	\frac{\text{d}N}{\text{d}t} = \alpha - \gamma N - \beta N(N-1),
\end{equation}
where the first term $\alpha$ is the loading rate or the amount of atoms entering the trap.
Next, $\gamma$ is the atom loss as a result of collisions with the background gas, so this is effectively a one-body loss term.
Lastly, $\gamma$ is a measure for the mainly two-body loss as a result of light-assisted collisions.
In this model, 3-body terms and higher are omitted.
In the regime $\beta \gg \gamma$, two-body loss rates are dominant over one-body contributions. 
We can now look at two distinct scenarios of an additional atom entering the trap:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Starting from 0 atoms present in the tweezer: an additional atom entering will now load the trap to $N=1$. 
	
	\item Starting from $N=1$: when an additional atom is loaded, the atoms will immediately kick out each other because of the tiny tweezer volume and strong light intensity from the MOT beams leading to $N=0$.
	
	\item In the situation that $N>1$, the atoms will be kicked out of the trap in pairs as a result of light-assisted collisions, until either $N=0$ or $N=1$.
\end{itemize}
Apparently, a loading event can lead to either 0 or 1 atom in the tweezer, both with $\sim 50\%$ probability. 
This is known as the collisional blockade mechanism and is also known as parity projection.
Experimentally demonstrated by \cite{Schlosser2001} and \cite{Schlosser2002} showed this effect to exits for 3 orders of magnitude in the loading rate $\alpha$.
Satisfying $\beta \gg \gamma$ can be done by keeping $\gamma$ to a minimum by going to the ultra high vacuum regime.
We intent to go to a pressure of the order of $10^{-10}$ mbar. In addition $\beta$ is maximized by going to high light-intensities and small trapping volumes. 
The remainder of this chapter is dedicated on how to minimize this trapping volume.

\section{Diffraction Limit}\label{sec:DiffractionLimit}

The smallest achievable spot size is governed by the diffraction limit; because of the wave character of light, there is a fundamental limit to the smallest spot size one can focus this wave, even in the absence of aberrations.
Diffraction theory is elegantly described by Fourier optics \cite{Goodman2005}. 
We present a short derivation of an important result from Fourier optics used throughout this work here, for the specific case of circular apertures.
For a more elaborate derivation, the reader is directed to \cref{Goodman2005}.

\begin{mdframed}
    \subsection*{Intermezzo Fourier Optics}
    
    When using a lens to form a focus, the lens will have a finite aperture.
    The light impinging on this aperture will show diffraction as a result.
    We call its complex amplitude $E(x',y')$ and position the aperture at axial coordinate $z = 0$ on the optical axis.
    After the aperture, the light field will show diffraction, described by the Fresnel diffraction integral in Cartesian coordinates \cite{Goodman2005}, leading to the complex field amplitude $E(x,y,z)$ after the aperture of 

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:FresnelDiffraction}
        E(x,y,z) = 
        \frac{e^{ikz}}{i \lambda z} \iint_{-\infty}^{\infty} E(x',y',0) \exp{\left(\frac{ik}{2z}\right)} \exp{\left[(x-x')^2+(y-y')^2\right]} dx'dy'.
    \end{equation}
    In \cref{eq:FresnelDiffraction}, $\lambdaup$ is the wavelength, $k=2\pi/\lambdaup$ the wavenumber. The aperture contribution is hidden in the term $E(x',y',0)$, which is zero when the condition $x'^2+y'^2>R^2$ is met, where $R$ is the radius of the circular aperture.
    During this work, we are usually not immediately interested in describing the light shortly after the aperture, but rather in the far field, motivating the use of the following Fraunhofer criterion
    
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:FraunhoferCriterion}
        z \gg \frac{k R^2}{2},
    \end{equation}
    While \cref{eq:FraunhoferCriterion} is in practice not met, it does near the focal point of a lens because a lens projects an image from infinity in its focal a length $f$ away. 
    Inserting \cref{eq:FraunhoferCriterion} in \cref{eq:FresnelDiffraction} yields the Fraunhofer diffraction integral:
    
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:FraunhoferDiffraction}
        E(x, y, z)=\frac{e^{i k z} e^{i k\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)/2}}{i \lambda z} \iint_{-\infty}^{\infty} E(x', y',0) \exp \left[\frac{-ik}{z}(x x'+y y')\right] dx' dy'.
    \end{equation}
    Because in this work we will usually compute the intensity as the absolute value squared, which will drop the phase factor in front of \cref{eq:FraunhoferRTheta}. Again, we only have to integrate over contributions within the aperture radius, such that we can write 
    
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:FraunhoferSimplified}
        E(x,y,z) \propto 
        \iint_{\text{aperture}} E(x',y') \exp{\left[- \frac{ik}{z}(xx'+yy')\right]}dx'dy'.
    \end{equation}
    This is the 2D spatial Fourier transform (in $x$ and $y$), with respectively spatial frequencies $f_x = x/\lambdaup z$ and $f_y = y/\lambdaup z$ and will be frequently used in this work.
\end{mdframed}
\vspace*{3mm}

\noindent For circular apertures, a description in cylindrical coordinates is more natural. 
Using the standard definitions for cylindrical coordinates, \cref{eq:FraunhoferSimplified} can be written as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:FraunhoferRTheta}
    E(r,\theta, z) \propto \iint_{\text{aperture}} E(r') \exp{\left[
    -\frac{i k r r'}{z} \cos{(\theta-\theta')} 
    \right]}r'dr'd\theta'.
\end{equation}
Using the integral definition of the Bessel function of the first kind\footnote{$J_0(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \exp{(i x \cos{\alpha})} d\alpha$}, this simplifies to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:FourierBessel}
    E(r,z) \propto 2\pi \int_0^{\infty} E(r') J_0\left( \frac{k r r'}{z}\right) r'dr',
\end{equation}
which is the Fourier-Bessel or Hankel transform.
Initially, we limit ourselves to potentials in the focus of the lens only, such that $z=f$. Also, for optical tweezers applications a fair assumption is that the incident light field is a Gaussian beam, with 'input' waist $w_i$, such that the light field is up to a normalization constant $A$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:GaussianAperture}
    E(r')=
    \begin{cases}
        A e^{- r'^2/w_i^2},& \text{if } r' < R\\
        0,               & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Substituting \cref{eq:GaussianAperture} in \cref{eq:FourierBessel} yields

\begin{equation}\label{eq:FourierBesselAperture}
    E(r) \propto \int_0^R e^{-r'^2/w_i^2} J_0\left(\frac{k r r'}{f}\right)r'dr'.
\end{equation}
\Cref{eq:FourierBesselAperture} is analytically solvable for specific cases \cite{Madjarov2020}.
Letting $w_i/R$ go to infinity, which is to treat the incident Gaussian beam as a plane wave, we can neglect the exponential term in \cref{eq:FourierBesselAperture}. 
The integral is now tractable, yielding for the field amplitude

\begin{equation}\label{eq:AiryField}
    E(r) \propto \frac{f}{kRr} J_1\left(\frac{k R r}{f}\right).
\end{equation}
Taking the absolute value squared and normalizing yields for the intensity the Airy function:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:NormalizedPSF}
    \frac{I}{I_0} = \left[
    \frac{2J_1(k r R/f)}{k r R/f}
    \right]^2.
\end{equation}
Which is plotted in \cref{fig:AiryPlots}, as well as the circle that results from \cref{eq:NormalizedPSF} known as the Airy disk.
Including the axial variable $z$ again, the optical response of a perfect lens to this plane wave is known as the \ac{PSF}, which we will use in \cref{sec:Tweezer3D}.
Solving for the first zero of \cref{eq:NormalizedPSF}, and introducing the definition of \ac{NA}: $\text{NA} = n \sin{\theta} =  R/f$, where $\theta$ is the maximum half angle and $n\approx1$ in air, yields for the radius of this Airy disk:

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{figures/AiryDisk.pdf}
    \caption{Normalized plots of the Airy function for \textbf{a)} only the radial coordinate (normalized in units of $f/kR$) as well as \textbf{b)} a 2D plot: the Airy disk.}
    \label{fig:AiryPlots}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Abbe}
    d_1 = 0.61 \frac{\lambdaup}{\text{NA}}.
\end{equation}
This result is known as the Abbe limit or diffraction limit \cite{Abbe1882} and it is the smallest feature a lens can produce.
To minimize $d_1$ in \cref{eq:Abbe} we can thus increase the \ac{NA} of our imaging system. 
In this work we will use $\text{NA} = 0.5$\footnote{For high NA imaging systems however, the paraxial approximation which was used to simplify the diffraction integral is no longer a priori true. 
Though, \cite{Chon2007} present a derivation of \cref{eq:Abbe} using a different diffraction theory that does not require paraxial approximation and showed that for collimated laser beams \cref{eq:Abbe} has negligible error even for $\text{NA} = 1$. 
We will assume we can still apply \cref{eq:Abbe} for $\text{NA} = 0.5$.}

In practice, it is not convenient to use \cref{eq:FourierBesselAperture} to fit data and it is more convenient to use a simpler function. 
A Gaussian function is commonly used, and can sometimes even fit better than \cref{eq:FourierBesselAperture} because the rings of the Airy disk are easily deformed because of aberrations \cite{Knottnerus2018}. 

\mbox{}\par
\begin{mdframed}
    \subsection*{Intermezzo Gaussian Beams}\label{sec:GaussianBeams}
    
    Because we will frequently use the parameters of a Gaussian beam, we will review them here. 
    Starting from Maxwell equations, one can derive under paraxial approximation a description of the transverse electromagnetic mode (TEM\textsubscript{00}) \cite{Leeuwen2017} for the electric field $E$.
    This Gaussian beam is most conveniently written down in cylindrical coordinates $\{r,z\}$:
    
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:GaussianBeam}
    	E(r,z) = \frac{w_0}{w(z)} \exp{\left(\frac{-r^2}{w^2(z)}\right)} \exp{\left[-ikz-i\frac{kr^2}{2R(z)} - i\psi(z)\right]},
    \end{equation}
    with parameters
    
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:GaussianBeamParameters}
    	k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambdaup}, \quad 
    	w(z) = \sqrt{w_0 + \frac{z^2}{z_R^2}}, \quad \text{and} \quad
    	R(z) = z \left(1 + \frac{z^2}{z_R^2}\right).
    \end{equation}
    Respectively, the wave number in terms of the wavelength $\lambdaup$, the beam waist, the radius where the field drops $1/e$ in terms of $w(z)\equiv w_0$ and $R(z)$ is the wavefront curvature. $z_R$ is the Rayleigh range, the distance along the optical axis where the beam waist has increased a factor of $\sqrt{2}$: $w(z=z_R) = \sqrt{2}w_0$.
    Finally $\psi(z)$ is an extra phase term originating from the curvature of the wavefront known as the Gouy phase.
    We find the intensity of the Gaussian beam by taking the absolute value squared:
    
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:GaussianBeamIntensity}
    	I(r,z) = I_0 \frac{w_0^2}{w^2(z)} \exp{\left(\frac{-2r^2}{w^2(z)}\right)}.
    \end{equation}
    A sketch of a Gaussian beam profile is given in \cref{fig:GaussianBeam}, showing the $1/e$ field radius, or $1/e^2$ intensity radius $w_0$ and the Rayleigh range $z_R$. 
    
    \vspace*{3mm}
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/GaussianBeam.pdf}
        \captionsetup{margin=0mm}%somehow this works
        \captionof{figure}{Gaussian beam profile and some key parameters used in this work, the beam waist $w_0$ and Rayleigh range $z_R$. 
        Figure adapted from \cite{Hermans2009}.}
        \label{fig:GaussianBeam}
\end{mdframed}

Fitting this Gaussian as closely as possible to an Airy pattern using a least-squares optimization, it can be shown that the equivalent Gaussian waist is \cite{Zhang2007}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:GaussianAiryFit}
    w = 0.42 \frac{\lambdaup}{\text{NA}}
\end{equation}
This the agreement of this approximation is excellent, but it is only valid near the center region of the Gaussian. 
If our measured waist is at this limit, the system is said to be diffraction limited, that is: the spot size is limited because of the wave character of light and not because of optical aberrations. 

At this point, it is instructive to get a feeling for the spatial profile of the dipole potential.
From \cref{eq:Stark} we know that the potential of the tweezer is proportional to the light intensity. 
Assuming the dipole potential can be described by a Gaussian, which is valid \cite{Zhang2007} near the center of the trap, the potential $U(r,z)$ in cylindrical coordinates is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:GaussianPotential}
    U(r,z)=\frac{-U_{0}}{1+z^{2} / z_{R}^{2}} \exp \left[\frac{-2 r^{2}}{w_{0}^{2}\left(1+z^{2} / z_{R}^{2}\right)}\right],
\end{equation}
where be used \cref{eq:GaussianBeam,eq:GaussianBeamParameters}.
\Cref{eq:GaussianPotential} is plotted in \cref{fig:GaussianPotential} as function of the normalized radial $r/w_0$ and axial $z/z_R$ coordinates. 
The figure is not to scale: the Rayleigh range $z_R$ is typically bigger than the waist $w_0$.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.56\linewidth]{figures/GaussianPotential.pdf}
    \caption{Normalized potential $U/U_0$ for a Gaussian trap shape as a function of the normalized cylindrical coordinates $r/w_0$ and $z/z_R$. Not to scale: typically the Rayleigh range $z_R$ is larger than the beam waist $w_0$.}

\end{figure}



\section{The Microscope Objective}\label{sec:TweezersPractice}

So to minimize \cref{eq:Abbe} and consequently minimize the volume of the optical trap, we need the highest possible numerical aperture, which are typically obtained by microscope objectives. 
But there are other demands on the microscope objective: the \ac{MOT} and subsequent \ac{ODT} are made in a vacuum chamber so the beam traverse a vacuum viewport, requiring:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ultra-long working distance (the distance between the trap and the lens). For a single lens, this is equivalent to the focal length $f$ of course, though for a compound microscope objective this does not have to be the case.
    
    \item Glass-thickness compensation. The relatively thick vacuum viewport will introduce a significant amount of aberrations for high NA and therefore large angles. It is possible to correct for this by having additional optics inside of the objective which will pre-correct for this error.
\end{enumerate}
To achieve this, we chose the G Plan Apo microscope objective from \textit{Mitutoyo}, as also used by \cite{Manuel2016,Ebadi2021}. 
This is an infinity-corrected objective, meaning light collected in its focused is imaged at infinity (parallel beam) and an additional field lens is used to focus this image, such that the magnification is 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:InfinityMagnification}
    M = \frac{f_2}{f_1},
\end{equation}
where $f_2$ is the focal length of the field lens and $f_1$ the equivalent focal length of the objective\footnote{For a compound microscope objective, equivalent focal length means the focal length the objective would have when replaced by a single lens.}.
This has the advantage that it is more flexible than a finite-conjugate corrected objective, as it allows to place additional optics between the laser and the objective without as well as optics between the objective and field lens without changing alignment.
Additionally, it allows flexible variation of the magnification according to \cref{eq:InfinityMagnification}.
Relevant specifications of the objective for applications in optical tweezers are shown in \cref{table:MitutoyoSpecs}. 
From compound objectives, the equivalent focal length $f_1$ is defined in terms of the \ac{NA} and the back aperture radius of $R$ as $f_1 = R / \text{NA}$, meaning the back aperture radius is 2 mm.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Key specifications of the objective from manufacturer Mitutoyo.}
    \label{table:MitutoyoSpecs}
    \begin{tabular}{l | l}
        \textbf{Specification}       & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline 
        NA                           & 0.5            \\ \hline
        Glass thickness compensation\footnote{We assume 3.5 mm of N-BK7 glass is used here, which has a slightly different refractive index than quartz for example.} & 3.5 mm         \\ \hline
        Equivalent focal length      & 4 mm           \\ \hline
        Working distance             & 15.08 mm      
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\noindent Because this objective was designed with visible wavelengths in mind, it is probable that all of the lenses inside it are coated with a reflection coating that does not work well for the 800 nm regime. 
This is indeed the case, as we measured the transmission of the objective to be just $(47 \pm 3)\%$ at 820 nm. 
Significant loss of laser power is therefore unavoidable.
But this is not the only source of laser power loss: in producing the perfect \ac{PSF} we assumed plane wave illumination ($w_i \gg R$, but in reality this is impractical: assuming the beam is aligned with the center of the aperture, the fraction of optical power $P/P_0$ traversing the aperture as a function of the incident waist $w_i$ is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:fracPowerCircular}
    P/P_0 = 1 - e^{-2w_i^2/R^2},
\end{equation}
which tends to zero for very wide beams (plane waves), which is not practical. 
On the other hand, the other extreme case is $w_i \ll R$: the waist is much smaller than the aperture and according to \cref{eq:fracPowerCircular} all of the power is transmitted through the aperture.
We can have a look at the shape of the resulting light potential: letting the integration boundary of \cref{eq:FourierBesselAperture} run to infinity and using another Hankel transform pair\footnote{$F_0(k) = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-1/2 a^2 r^2} J_0(k r)r dr = \frac{1}{a^2} e^{-\frac{k^2}{2a^2}}$ \cite{Papoulis2981}.} find 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:GaussianCase}
    U(r) \propto \frac{w_i^2}{2} \exp{\left(\frac{-k^2w_i^2 r^2}{2f^2}\right)},
\end{equation}
which is a Gaussian, but with a modified waist of $\lambdaup f / \pi w_i$.
This modified waist will go up for smaller $w_i$ (Fourier transform property). 
Clearly, this is not ideal either. 
To understand the optimum a bit better, we will define the concept of trap frequencies. 
But a priori we know the resulting potential will be something in between a Gaussian beam and an Airy pattern. 

Assuming a Gaussian is justified because near the center, an Airy disk and Gaussian beam are nearly identical.
We are interested in potentials much deeper than the temperature of the atoms, such that the atoms will mostly occupy the bottom of the tweezer. 
Taylor expanding \cref{eq:GaussianPotential} around $(r,z)=(0,0)$ to second order yields 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ApproximateGaussianPotential}
    U(r,z) \sim -U_0 - 2U_0 \frac{r^2}{w_0^2} - 2U_0 \frac{z^2}{z_R^2}
\end{equation}


For this harmonic potential, one can compute the harmonic oscillation frequencies 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:TrapFrequencies}
    \omega_r = 2\left(\frac{U_0}{m w_0^2}\right)^{1/2}, \quad
    \omega_z= \left(\frac{2 U_0}{m z_R^2}\right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}
Because $z_R > w_0$, the longitudinal oscillation frequency is lower than the radial frequency. 
Trap frequencies are a nice property to optimize, because from the definition, higher trap frequencies translate to deeper as well as sharper tweezers. 
\cite{Madjarov2021} optimized \cref{eq:TrapFrequencies} for the $w_i/R$ ratio and found an optimum around $w_i\sim R$, which we will use in this work\footnote{Because trap frequencies can be probed exprimentally, they can be used to perform post-corrections on tweezer arrays as well as shown by \cite{Ebadi2021}.}.

\section{Measuring the Tweezer potential}\label{sec:MeasuringTweezer}

We would like to measure tweezer potential made by our microscope objective. 
We could use time symmetry and look at the reverse direction: using the objective to look at a pinhole, retrieving its \acf{PSF} \cite{Knottnerus2018,Sortais2007}
However, using this method the objective will produce a plane wave, when we know that in practice we do not send a plane wave to the objective as discussed in \cref{sec:TweezersPractice}
function. 

Instead, we used another microscope objective, to look into produced tweezer potential by the \textit{Mitutoyo}. 
In doing this, the tweezer potential will be convolved with the \ac{PSF} of the second microscope objective\cite{Baumgaertner2017}.
Therefore we used a second microscope objective\footnote{Newport M-60X 0.85 NA objective.} with significantly higher \ac{NA}, minimizing this effect. 

\subsection{Optical Setup}

In the actual machine, we use an optically contacted glass cell as our vacuum chamber. Because no objective exists that has significantly higher NA than 0.5 as well as ultra-long working distance, we can not look into the glass cell using this method. Therefore, we use a piece of glass with the same thickness and material (quartz glass, $d = 4.0$) mm to imitate the glass cell. The second objective will produce an image onto a linear CCD camera\footnote{Point Grey FLEA2 FL2-08S2M.}. Because alignment of the Mitutoyo objective with the incident beam, as well as alignment of the two objectives with respect to each other is crucial, both objectives are mounted on piezo-controlled 5 axis translation stages. 
This is drawn in the lower-right corner of \cref{fig:TiSandSLMsetup}.

On top we show the laser source used.
This laser is positioned on a separate table and its output is brought to the main table using a \ac{PM} optical fiber. 
The laser source is a \ac{Ti:S} ring laser\footnote{\textit{Coherent} 899-21 ring laser} (linewidth $\sim 1$ Mhz, output power max. $\sim 1$ W.). 
The crystal is pumped using a pump laser\footnote{\textit{Coherent} Verdi V18} (18W power, 532 nm). 
The \ac{Ti:S} is eaily tunable in wavelength over a wide range. For Sr 813 will be used, but for the experiments for Rb we used 820 nm. 
In between the laser source and the objective, there is a \ac{SLM}. But the SLM has its own \cref{ch:arrays}, so will not get into that now. 
In day to day tuning of the mirrors inside the Ti:S ring laser, the output angle and therefore the fiber coupling efficiency is slightly changed. 
To ease the coupling, we run a coax cable from a power meter on the main table to a multimeter on the Ti:S table. 

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/TiSandSLM.pdf}

    All cubes are polarizing.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Calibration Imaging System}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.5\linewidth]{figures/LEDcalibration.pdf}
    \caption{Illumination of the calibration target by an LED, imaged by the 0.85 NA objective and camera at fixed distance.}
    \label{fig:resolutionTarget}
\end{figure}

The 60X magnification of the 0.85 NA objective is only specified when used in a microscope with standard tube length distance, because it is finite conjugate corrected.
Outside of a standard microscope, we have to calibrate its exact magnification.
We do this using a high resolution target\footnote{Technologie Manufaktur TC-RT01}, featuring groups of lines with variable spacing between them. 
The way this was done is shown in \cref{fig:resolutionTarget}.
Initially, we tried to use laser light to illuminate the target, but we did not get a clear image. 
Most likely this is because of the diffracting beams interfering with each other. 
To combat this we used light from an incoherent light source (\ac{LED}). We neglect the slightly different focus point from the Newport objective for our laser frequency compared to white light. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.42\linewidth]{figures/LineSpacingCalibration.pdf}
    \caption{Image from the resolution target illuminated showing lines spaced by 45 lines per mm.}
    \label{fig:resolutionTarget}
\end{figure}

To detect the edges in \cref{fig:resolutionTarget}, we use an edge detection algorithm script.
For several 1D row slices of the image, it blurs the edge using a Gaussian to suppress noise and subsequently computes the spatial derivative. 
When the derivative surpasses a set threshold we define it as an edge.
Dividing the pixel spacing of the lines by the pixel pitch of the camera ($4.65$ $\mu$m) we find a magnification of ($67 \pm 3$)X, which is larger than the 60X specified by Newport. 
We attribute this to a slightly longer objective-camera distance that was used. 
After the calibration was performed, the objective-camera distance was left untouched. 

\section{Tweezer Images: Radial}\label{sec:TweezerRadial}

An image of the CCD camera is shown in \cref{fig:SingleSpotZoomed}. 
There seems to be a small tilt aberration present as the side ring is more clearly visible on the right side. 
We found aberrations of this magnitude almost impossible to get rid of, as it could originate from anywhere between the input beam and the camera.

In \cref{fig:AzimuthalAverage} we have integrated the intensity in rings around the maximum with a width of 1 pixel, effectively computing an azimuthal average. 
This result is compared against the \ac{PSF} of the objective (\cref{eq:NormalizedPSF}), as well as the result from scalar diffraction theory using a Gaussian input beam equal to the aperture $w_i \sim R$, which was obtained by computing \cref{eq:FourierBesselAperture} for a sample of radial coordinates $r$.

\end{figure}


So, if a Gaussian input beam used, the resulting spot will be slightly broader.
Additionally, the rings of the Airy disk will be slightly surpressed, this effect is known as Gaussian apodization.
This plot is convenient for showing the general behavior, but is not accurate enough to extract data like the waist. 
For example: in this binning method, distance to the center pixel are calculated, but the center could be anywhere on this pixel. 
Therefore we also perform a two-dimensional Gaussian fit using \cref{eq:2DGaussian}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2DGaussian}
    \frac{G(x,y)}{G_0} =  
    \exp{\left[ -\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma_x^2}\right]}
    \exp{\left[ -\frac{(y-x_0)^2}{2\sigma_y^2}\right]}
\end{equation}

The result of this fit is shown in \cref{fig:3Dshowing}. 
Cleary, the obtained tweezer potential fits very well to a Gaussian, which justifies the assumption of using a Gaussian approximation to estimate the trap frequencies (\cref{eq:GaussianPotential}. 
This is confirmed by the coefficient of determination $R^2 > 0.99$.

\end{figure}

Assuming the $\sigma_x \sim \sigma_y$ which should be the case for a circlar aperture, we find the waist as $w_0 = \sigma_x + \sigma_y = (0.88 \pm 0.04)$ $\mu$m, where the error originates mainly from the calibration of the magnification. 
In order to find this waist, a smaller, 10 by 10 pixel region of interest was used, see \cref{fig:3Dfits}.
Despite the 0.85 NA used, there will still be a slight convolution with the imaging point spread function present. 
Although in deconvolution is non-trivial in general, for a Gaussian it is quite straightforward \cite{Knottnerus2018} in terms of the waists of the image and the diffraction-limited waist of the imaging system:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Deconvolution}
    w_{\text{object}} = \sqrt{w_{\text{image}}^2-w_{\text{system}}^2}.
\end{equation}

This gives an object waist of $w_{\text{obj}} = (0.77 \pm 0.05)$ $\mu$m. 
Comparing to the theory result, for $\lambdaup = 820$ nm and $\text{NA} = 0.5$ (\cref{eq:Abbe,eq:GaussianAiryFit}) yields $w_0 = 0.689$ $\mu$m. 
But this result unachievale because of $w_i \sim R$ used. 
We know that as a result of this, the waist should be $\approx$9-10\% larger \cite{Sortais2007,Chon2007} which was confirmed by \cref{eq:FourierBesselAperture}, yielding $w_0 \sim 0.75$ $\mu$m, which lies within the error margin.
We conclude the tweezer is nearly diffraction-limited in size.

We did apply some aberration correction, which is mainly described in the next section \cref{sec:Tweezer3D}.
The result shown is after this aberration correction, though this this not significantly improve the result. 
We did note an improvement mainly for the axial direction which the next section is about. 


\section{Tweezer: Axial Direction}\label{sec:Tweezer3D}

For the volume of the tweezer not only the radial direction is important, but the axial (longitudinal) direction as well. 
The relevevant quantity here is the Rayleigh range (see \cref{fig:GaussianBeam}).
For the radial images shown in \cref{fig:2Dresults} we were intially surprised that the results was already pretty good even before aberration correction, because we know for example that the optical thickness of the glass cell (and the quartz plate that replaces the glass cell, \cref{fig:TiSandSLMsetup} is about 0.5 mm too thick: the objective is designed for 3.5 mm of N-BK7 (refractive inded $n = 1.51$, $nd = 5.3$ mm) whereas the cell is 4.0 mm of quartz glass ($n = 1.44$, $nd = 5.8$ mm). 
This might seem insignicant, but because of the high \ac{NA} and consequently large angles under which the light traverses the glass, it is possible the outer (marginal) rays will focus at at a slightly different point than the inner (paraxial) rays. 
To study the axial direction, we scan the Mitutoyo objective along the optical ($z$) axis and record an image of the tweezer. 
In the end, all images are stiched together to make a single image that would give an idea of a sideview of the tweezer.
To calibrate the amount of translation we calibrated the step size of the motor. The optical setup is shown in \cref{fig:ZScanSetup}

\subsection{Picomotor Attenuator Calibration}

Piezo-controlled attenuaters are very good at producing minisclule ($<30$ mm) step sizes. The step size is also extremely constant, making them ideal for axials scans like this.
The stage we used is 8081-M 5-axis motorized tilt aligner from Newport. 
Because of the 5 degrees of freedom, it can accurately align the two objectives with each other. 
To drive this stage, we used a set of Newport 8742 controllers in daisy-chain configuration: both can drive 4 motors so we have 2 of them to address all 5 motors.
For scanning the axial direction of the tweezer we only use one of the 5 motors inthe stage. 
However, to know the exact step size calibration is needed because the step size is dependent on the torque applied, which depends on the direction of travel as well as whether the motor has to counter gravity, etc.
In order to do this, we repeatedly measured the available translation range of some $\sim$ 3mm, recording the amount of steps this takes as well as the amount moved using a caliper. 
We found a step calibration of $10.6 \pm 0.2$ $\mu$m/step, which was used to translate amount of steps to distances.
