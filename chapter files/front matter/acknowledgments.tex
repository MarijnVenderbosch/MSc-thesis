\noindent I had help from a lot of people in writing this thesis.
First of all I would like Edgar for being my supervisor last year. 
We had plenty of freedom to give our own twist to the project but you were always closely involved.
Servaas, thanks for your enthusiasm and creative ideas.

Deon and Rik, I really enjoyed working with you.
I think we were a well-organized team complimenting each other well.
We also had a ton on fun in the process.
Deon, our progress really accelerated since your arrival. 

From a larger distance, it was really nice that I could talk with Ivo about SLM stuff.
Thanks for the many useful optics and SLM tips as well as the fun borrels.
Alex, thanks a lot for your enthusiastic and elaborate feedback during the meetings, and thanks for showing us around in your lab in Amsterdam!
This also goes for Robert and Florian. 

Back to Eindhoven within the group there was plenty of help as well.
Thanks to Robert and Madhav for inspring theoretical discusions.
There was technical help from Eddy, Harry and Jeroen, many thanks.
Also thanks to collegue experimentallists for helping out whenever needed (Yang, Tim, Daniel, Sheng, Luc).
Lastly I would like to thank all other group members for all coffee breaks, seminar and borrels. 
I can happily look back to the past year at CQT.
