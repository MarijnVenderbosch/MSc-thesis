\noindent I would like to thank a number of people for helping me write this thesis. 
Without their help, it would not have been completed.

Edgar and Servaas, thanks for giving me the trust to work on this ultra-cool project. 
Edgar, you gave me a lot of freedom in going my own way, but when I ran into difficulties you were always there to help. 
Your comments improved the quality of my work. 
Servaas, you are an incredibly enthusiastic physicist. 
You had a lot of creative ideas, which I very much appreciated. 

Deon and Rik, I really enjoyed working with you.
We had a ton of fun, but I think we were also a well-organized team complimenting each other.
Deon, you were the driving force in quickly getting us up to speed with the Rb machine.
Without you we would be nowhere near where we are now.

Ivo, thanks for taking the time to discuss some optics and SLM stuff whenever i needed it. 
It was really useful for me 
You know a great deal about optics.
Alex, thanks for your particularly useful suggestions from first-hand experience. 
Thanks to you both for taking an entire day of time to show us around in your lab, 
Robert and Florian, thank you for feedback during the shared meetings.

Furthermore I want to thank Eddy, Harry and Jeroen for excellent technical help. 
Also thanks to Yang, Tim, Daniel, Sheng and Luc for helping around in the lab whenever needed.

Lastly I would like to thank all other group members for all vlaai breaks, seminars and borrels. 
With the Christmas tree up all year round, I really felt at home in the 'master room'. 
I will look back happily on the past year at CQT.
