\noindent I would like to mention a number of people for helping me write this thesis. 
Without their help, it would not have been completed.

Edgar and Servaas, thank you for giving me the trust to work on this ultra-cool project. 
Edgar, you gave me a lot of freedom in going my own way, but when I ran into difficulties you were always there to help. 
Your comments improved the quality of my work. 
Servaas, thank you for your creative ideas and positive attitude. 
Your optimistic view motivated me to work harder on this project. 

Deon and Rik, I really enjoyed working with you.
We had a ton of fun, but I think we were also a well-organized team complimenting each other.
Deon, you were the driving force in quickly getting us up to speed with the Rb machine.
Without you we would be nowhere near where we are now.

There were also some people in Amsterdam.
Ivo, whenever I needed some help on optics you were always there to help. 
Thanks for the invaluable advice. 
Alex, thanks for your incredibly useful suggestions from first-hand experience. 
And thanks to you both for showing us around your Sr experiment, which was really impressive.
Robert and Florian, thank you for feedback as well.

Back to Eindhoven I want to thank Eddy, Harry and Jeroen for excellent technical help. 
Also thanks to Luc, Yang, Tim, Daniel and Sheng for helping around in the lab whenever needed.
Lastly I would like to thank all other group members for all vlaai breaks, seminars and borrels. 
With the Christmas tree up all year round, I really felt at home in the 'master room'. 
I will look back happily on the past year at CQT.
